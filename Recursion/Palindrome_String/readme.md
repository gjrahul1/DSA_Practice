## Palindrome String
#### You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Examples :

Input: s = "abba"

Output: true

Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

Input: s = "abc" 

Output: false

Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.

Input: s = "a"

Output: true

Explanation: A single-character string is always a palindrome.

Input: s = "acbca"

Output: true

Explanation: "acbca" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

Constraints:

1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 106

The string s contains only lowercase letters (a-z).
